NAME
    Math::ThinPlateSpline - Calculate and evaluate thin plate splines

SYNOPSIS
      my @control_points = (
          [$x, $y, $z],
          [$x2, $y2, $z2],
          ...
      );
      my $regularization = 0.; # default, follow control points slavishly
  
      my $tps = Math::ThinPlateSpline->new(
        \@control_points,
        $regularization
      );
  
      my $height = $tps->evaluate($x, $y);
      my $bending_energy = $tps->get_bending_energy();

      my $heights = $tps->evaluate_many([$x1, $x2, $x3...], [$y1, $y2, $y3...]);
      # $heights is now [$z1, $z2, $z3...]

DESCRIPTION
    This is a small Perl/XS module for calculating and evaluating thin plate
    splines. If you don't know what thin plate splines are, check out the
    links in the "SEE ALSO" section. In a nutshell, it's ordinary splines
    generalized to two dimensions.

    The module includes a copy of the "tpsfit" C++ library that was created
    on the basis of the "tpsdemo" program by Jarno Elonen.

METHODS
  new
    (class method)

    Creates a new thin plate spline. Takes one mandatory parameter: A
    reference to an array of control points (at least three). Each control
    point has to be a reference to an array of three numbers (X, Y, Z
    coordinates). See SYNOPSIS.

    The second parameter is optional: A measure for the regularization. See
    Jarno Elonen's page for details.

  evaluate
    Takes an x and y coordinate as arguments. Returns the z coordinate of
    the thin plate spline at the specified point.

  get_bending_energy
    Calculates and returns the thin plate spline's bending energy. Again,
    Jarno Elonen explains this well on his "tpsdemo" page.

DEPENDENCIES
    Apart from Perl modules (see META.yml or Makefile.PL), this module needs
    the boost:ublas library to build (including headers).
